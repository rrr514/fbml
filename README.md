Current Plan - 4 positional ML models

RB/FB model:
- rush attempts per game
- rush yards per game
- rush tds per game
- targets per game
- recs per game
- rec yards per game
- rec tds per game

WR model:
- targets per game
- recs per game
- rec yards per game
- rec tds per game

TE model:
- targets per game
- recs per game
- rec yards per game
- rec tds per game

QB model:
- pass attempts per game
- passing yds per game
- passing tds per game
- interceptions per game
- rush yds per game
- rush tds per game

Benchmark Metrics:
- R² at least 0.3–0.5
- RMSE between 40-60
- MAE between 30-50

Rookie QB Model:
- Games Played
- Completion Percentage
- passing yds per game
- passing tds per game
- interceptions per game

Rookie RB/FB Model:
- Games Played
- rush attempts per game
- rush yards per game
- rush tds per game

# TODO List:
- fix rookie qb model overfitting (fixing all rookie models in general lol)
- eventually add more training data for all models
